If any of these criteria are not mentioned, the overall answer should be \"No.\"\n\nIn your response, adhere strictly to the format below and address each part with specific references to the text:\n\n***\n\nOverall Answer: {Yes/No}\nPart A: {Yes/ No}\nReasoning A: {A brief justification for this part of your answer, citing relevant sections of the paper}\n\nPart B: {Yes/ No}\nReasoning B: {A brief justification for this part of your answer, citing relevant sections of the paper}\n\nPart C: {Yes/ No}\nReasoning C: {A brief justification for this part of your answer, citing relevant sections of the paper}\n\n***\n\nMake sure you consider all sentences in the manuscirpt and always keep the following questions in mind:\n\nDoes the paper involves wet lab experimental procedures in electrochemical synthesis?\nPart A: Does the paper involves experimental procedures and non-computational/non-simulation data in electrochemical synthesis?\nPatr B: Does the paper detail C-H oxidation specifically leading to C-H bond (alcohol) or C=O bond (carbonyl) compounds? Note that the coupling products where C-H becomes C-OR group do not count. Also note that only functionalization of C-H bonds without clear indication on C-OH bond or C=O bond does not count. \nPatr C: Is the reaction happening in aliphatic carbon or sp3 C-H bond?\n\nTake a deep breathe and read it, consider all the expectations, analyze and give reasoning in details step by step. It is very important to my research.\n\nManuscript:",
