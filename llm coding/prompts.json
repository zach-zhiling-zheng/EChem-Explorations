Since right now we have not yet started, the priority is 0 for all experiments at the beginning. Then you randomly select 5 initial reaction conditions, to which you assign priority 1.

You can write a function call \"update_yield\" which takes a csv, row number, and yield as input and then overwrites the csv by changing the pending yield for priority 1 conditions to observed yields.\n\nThen, to get the next 5 experiments, you should write a function called \"reaction_optimization\", every time it will take \"echem_reaction_opt_roundxxx.csv\" as input, verify that all \"priority 1\" experiments have all filled with observed yield values, and assign their priority to -1 as these experiments are now completed, then suggest 5 more experiments using the \"Optimizer\" class from skopt with the gaussian process as an estimator and expected improvement as function to tell and ask for next 5 points, remember the search space can only come from the priority 0 experiments in the csv since these are the experiments we have not yet conducted, while those \"-1\" experiments serve as your data points for optimization. After the optimizer suggests 5 conditions, make a new copy of csv with round n+1 in its name (e.g. \"echem_reaction_opt_round1.csv\" if the previous is round0; \"echem_reaction_opt_round5.csv\" if the previous is round4), match the suggested condition with the row number and change their priority from 0 to 1, and sort by priority so that the suggested 5 reactions come first (priority 1), the pending reactions next (priority 0), and the last rows are the 5 completed reactions (-1). Make sure the suggested experiments are unique and will not overlap with the completed ones (in other words, the suggestion can not be the same row with priority -1), and ensure all synthesis parameters are discrete and the choice must be placed based on the generated search scope (for priority 0). In other words, the new \"1\" priority experiment must come from the \"0\" priority rows. \n\nOnce you complete these two functions, you run them in sequence.

Bayesian reaction optimization as a tool for chemical synthesis) from https://github.com/doyle-lab-ucla/edboplus. Please carefully read it\n```\nfrom edbo.plus.optimizer_botorch import EDBOplus\n\n#### This is a tutorial that covers the basics for running EDBO+: from designing a combinatorial space to running the Bayesian Optimizer.\n\n## 1. Creating a search scope using EDBO+.\n\n\n##### To run EDBO+ we need to first create a reaction scope (search space) in a .csv format with all the possible combinations that you want to consider for our optimization. \n##### You can \"manually\" create a reaction scope using any spreadsheet editor (such as Excel, Libreoffice Calc, ...) but we have also created a tool to help you generating combinatorial search spaces. \n##### For instance, lets say that we want to consider 3 solvents ($\bf{THF}$, $\bf{Toluene}$, $\bf{DMSO}$), 4 temperatures ($\bf{-10}$, $\bf{0}$, $\bf{10}$, $\bf{25}$) and 3 concentration levels ($\bf{0.1}$, $\bf{0.2}$, $\bf{1.0}$). We can introduce these in the EDBO+ scope generator in a dictionary form as follows:\n\n\nreaction_components = {\n    'solvent': ['THF', 'Toluene', 'DMSO'],\n    'T': [-10, 0, 10, 25],\n    'concentration': [0.1, 0.2, 1.0]\n}\n\n\n##### Now we need to pass the previous dictionary to the $\bf{generate\\_reaction\\_scope}$ tool in the EDBOplus class.\n\nEDBOplus().generate_reaction_scope(\n    components=reaction_components, \n    filename='my_optimization.csv',\n    check_overwrite=False\n)\n\nGenerating reaction scope...\nsolvent\tT\tconcentration\n0\tTHF\t-10\t0.1\n1\tTHF\t-10\t0.2\n2\tTHF\t-10\t1.0\n3\tTHF\t0\t0.1\n4\tTHF\t0\t0.2\n5\tTHF\t0\t1.0\n6\tTHF\t10\t0.1\n7\tTHF\t10\t0.2\n8\tTHF\t10\t1.0\n9\tTHF\t25\t0.1\n10\tTHF\t25\t0.2\n11\tTHF\t25\t1.0\n12\tToluene\t-10\t0.1\n13\tToluene\t-10\t0.2\n14\tToluene\t-10\t1.0\n15\tToluene\t0\t0.1\n16\tToluene\t0\t0.2\n17\tToluene\t0\t1.0\n18\tToluene\t10\t0.1\n19\tToluene\t10\t0.2\n20\tToluene\t10\t1.0\n21\tToluene\t25\t0.1\n22\tToluene\t25\t0.2\n23\tToluene\t25\t1.0\n24\tDMSO\t-10\t0.1\n25\tDMSO\t-10\t0.2\n26\tDMSO\t-10\t1.0\n27\tDMSO\t0\t0.1\n28\tDMSO\t0\t0.2\n29\tDMSO\t0\t1.0\n30\tDMSO\t10\t0.1\n31\tDMSO\t10\t0.2\n32\tDMSO\t10\t1.0\n33\tDMSO\t25\t0.1\n34\tDMSO\t25\t0.2\n35\tDMSO\t25\t1.0\n\n##### We can always load/read the previously generated reaction scope using any spreadsheet editor but in this case we will use Pandas for that:\n\nimport pandas as pd\ndf_scope = pd.read_csv('my_optimization.csv')  # Load csv file.\n\n##### Now we can check the number of combinations in the reaction scope:\n\nn_combinations = len(df_scope)\nprint(f\"Your reaction scope has {n_combinations} combinations.\")\n\n\nYour reaction scope has 36 combinations.\n\n##### Of course, this is a very small reaction scope  as it is meant to be a toy model to demonstrate how EDBO+ works.\n\n## 2. First steps, initializing EDBO+ (in absence of training data).\n\n##### We are going to execute EDBO+ to suggest some initial samples. \n##### Since we have not collected any experimental data (observations) yet, EDBO+ will suggest a set of initial experiments based on an feature space sampling method, in this case the CVT sampling method (see:http://kmh-lanl.hansonhub.com/uncertainty/meetings/gunz03vgr.pdf).\n##### In this example the $\bf{objective}$ is to maximize the reaction $\bf{yield}$ and $\bf{enantioselectivity}$ but at the same time we want to minimize the amount one of a given $\bf{side~product}$ in this reaction. We also need to introduce the name of the csv file containing our reaction scope (in our case this was $\bf{my\\_optimization.csv}$). Now we can execute the algorithm using the $\bf{run}$ command in EDBOplus:\n\n\nEDBOplus().run(\n    filename='my_optimization.csv',  # Previously generated scope.\n    objectives=['yield', 'ee', 'side_product'],  # Objectives to be optimized.\n    objective_mode=['max', 'max', 'min'],  # Maximize yield and ee but minimize side_product.\n    batch=3,  # Number of experiments in parallel that we want to perform in this round.\n    columns_features='all', # features to be included in the model.\n    init_sampling_method='cvtsampling'  # initialization method.\n)\n\n\n\nThe following columns are categorical and will be encoded using One-Hot-Encoding: ['solvent']\nSampling type:  selection \n\n\nNumber of unique samples returned by sampling algorithm: 3\nCreating a priority list using random sampling: cvtsampling\n\n\tsolvent\tT\tconcentration\tyield\tee\tside_product\tpriority\n32\tDMSO\t10\t1.0\tPENDING\tPENDING\tPENDING\t1\n8\tTHF\t10\t1.0\tPENDING\tPENDING\tPENDING\t1\n19\tToluene\t10\t0.2\tPENDING\tPENDING\tPENDING\t1\n0\tTHF\t-10\t0.1\tPENDING\tPENDING\tPENDING\t0\n26\tDMSO\t-10\t1.0\tPENDING\tPENDING\tPENDING\t0\n21\tToluene\t25\t0.1\tPENDING\tPENDING\tPENDING\t0\n22\tToluene\t25\t0.2\tPENDING\tPENDING\tPENDING\t0\n23\tToluene\t25\t1.0\tPENDING\tPENDING\tPENDING\t0\n24\tDMSO\t-10\t0.1\tPENDING\tPENDING\tPENDING\t0\n25\tDMSO\t-10\t0.2\tPENDING\tPENDING\tPENDING\t0\n\n\n##### EDBO+ has created a column for each objective and added $\bf{PENDING}$ values to all of them so you can track the experiments that you have been collecting during the optimization campaign.\n##### We can also see that EDBO+ has created a new $\bf{priority}$ column. This column is used to distinguish between high and low priority samples. The top entries (with $\bf{priority=1}$) highlight the next suggested samples.\n\n\n##### We can check now the first 5 experiments in the scope by reading the $\bf{my\\_optimization.csv}$ file:\n\n\ndf_edbo = pd.read_csv('my_optimization.csv')\ndf_edbo.head(5)\n\nsolvent\tT\tconcentration\tyield\tee\tside_product\tpriority\n0\tDMSO\t10\t1.0\tPENDING\tPENDING\tPENDING\t1\n1\tTHF\t10\t1.0\tPENDING\tPENDING\tPENDING\t1\n2\tToluene\t10\t0.2\tPENDING\tPENDING\tPENDING\t1\n3\tTHF\t-10\t0.1\tPENDING\tPENDING\tPENDING\t0\n4\tDMSO\t-10\t1.0\tPENDING\tPENDING\tPENDING\t0\n\n\n## 3. Adding training data in EDBO+.\n\n##### Note: We will use Python and Pandas to add new training data in this example. But you can always edit and add new data into the '.csv' file using any spreedsheet editor (such as Excel, Libreoffice Calc, ...) if that's more convinient for you.\n\n##### Let's open again the $\bf{my\\_optimization.csv}$ file we generated before:\n\ndf_edbo = pd.read_csv('my_optimization.csv')\ndf_edbo.head(5)\n\n\tsolvent\tT\tconcentration\tyield\tee\tside_product\tpriority\n0\tDMSO\t10\t1.0\tPENDING\tPENDING\tPENDING\t1\n1\tTHF\t10\t1.0\tPENDING\tPENDING\tPENDING\t1\n2\tToluene\t10\t0.2\tPENDING\tPENDING\tPENDING\t1\n3\tTHF\t-10\t0.1\tPENDING\tPENDING\tPENDING\t0\n4\tDMSO\t-10\t1.0\tPENDING\tPENDING\tPENDING\t0\n\n\n##### We can fill the first out entry in the previous dataframe with the \"observed\" values using Pandas:\n\n\ndf_edbo.loc[0, 'yield'] = 20.5\ndf_edbo.loc[0, 'ee'] = 40\ndf_edbo.loc[0, 'side_product'] = 0.1\n\n##### We can check that we have filled out the first entry with our \"observed data\":\n\ndf_edbo.head(5)\n\n\tsolvent\tT\tconcentration\tyield\tee\tside_product\tpriority\n0\tDMSO\t10\t1.0\t20.5\t40\t0.1\t1\n1\tTHF\t10\t1.0\tPENDING\tPENDING\tPENDING\t1\n2\tToluene\t10\t0.2\tPENDING\tPENDING\tPENDING\t1\n3\tTHF\t-10\t0.1\tPENDING\tPENDING\tPENDING\t0\n4\tDMSO\t-10\t1.0\tPENDING\tPENDING\tPENDING\t0\n\n##### We can also fill out the second entry with their corresponding \"observations\":\n\ndf_edbo.loc[1, 'yield'] = 50.3\ndf_edbo.loc[1, 'ee'] = 10\ndf_edbo.loc[1, 'side_product'] = 0.2\n\n\ndf_edbo.head(5)\n\nsolvent\tT\tconcentration\tyield\tee\tside_product\tpriority\n0\tDMSO\t10\t1.0\t20.5\t40\t0.1\t1\n1\tTHF\t10\t1.0\t50.3\t10\t0.2\t1\n2\tToluene\t10\t0.2\tPENDING\tPENDING\tPENDING\t1\n3\tTHF\t-10\t0.1\tPENDING\tPENDING\tPENDING\t0\n4\tDMSO\t-10\t1.0\tPENDING\tPENDING\tPENDING\t0\n\n##### Now we can save our dataset as $\bf{my\\_optimization\\_round0.csv}$:\n\ndf_edbo.to_csv('my_optimization_round0.csv', index=False)\n\n\n## 4. Running EDBO+ with training data.\n\n##### First let's check our previous data (which include some $\bf{yield}$, $\bf{ee}$ and $\bf{side\\_product}$ observations, which will be used to train the model):\n\ndf_edbo_round0 = pd.read_csv('my_optimization_round0.csv')\ndf_edbo_round0.head(5)\n\n\tsolvent\tT\tconcentration\tyield\tee\tside_product\tpriority\n0\tDMSO\t10\t1.0\t20.5\t40\t0.1\t1\n1\tTHF\t10\t1.0\t50.3\t10\t0.2\t1\n2\tToluene\t10\t0.2\tPENDING\tPENDING\tPENDING\t1\n3\tTHF\t-10\t0.1\tPENDING\tPENDING\tPENDING\t0\n4\tDMSO\t-10\t1.0\tPENDING\tPENDING\tPENDING\t0\n\n\n##### Now that we have introduced some \"observations\" in our $\bf{my\\_optimization\\_round0.csv}$ file, we can execute EDBO+ to suggest samples using these \"observations\" as training data.\n\nEDBOplus().run(\n    filename='my_optimization_round0.csv',  # Previous scope (including observations).\n    objectives=['yield', 'ee', 'side_product'],  # Objectives to be optimized.\n    objective_mode=['max', 'max', 'min'],  # Maximize yield and ee but minimize side_product.\n    batch=3,  # Number of experiments in parallel that we want to perform in this round.\n    columns_features='all', # features to be included in the model.\n    init_sampling_method='cvtsampling'  # initialization method.\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following columns are categorical and will be encoded using One-Hot-Encoding: ['solvent']\nUsing EHVI acquisition function.\nUsing hyperparameters optimized for continuous variables.\nUsing hyperparameters optimized for continuous variables.\nUsing hyperparameters optimized for continuous variables.\nNumber of QMC samples using SobolQMCNormalSampler sampler: 512\nAcquisition function optimized.\nPredictions obtained and expected improvement obtained.\nsolvent\tT\tconcentration\tyield\tee\tside_product\tpriority\n19\tTHF\t-10\t0.2\tPENDING\tPENDING\tPENDING\t1.0\n35\tDMSO\t25\t1.0\tPENDING\tPENDING\tPENDING\t1.0\n10\tDMSO\t0\t0.2\tPENDING\tPENDING\tPENDING\t1.0\n7\tToluene\t25\t1.0\tPENDING\tPENDING\tPENDING\t0.0\n6\tToluene\t25\t0.2\tPENDING\tPENDING\tPENDING\t0.0\n5\tToluene\t25\t0.1\tPENDING\tPENDING\tPENDING\t0.0\n17\tToluene\t10\t1.0\tPENDING\tPENDING\tPENDING\t0.0\n2\tToluene\t10\t0.2\tPENDING\tPENDING\tPENDING\t0.0\n18\tToluene\t10\t0.1\tPENDING\tPENDING\tPENDING\t0.0\n\n\n##### Again the samples suggested by EDBO+ have $\bf{priority = +1}$.
